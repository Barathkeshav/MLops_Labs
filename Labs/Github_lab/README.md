#Changes to model_train.py

The training script has been updated with several critical improvements to enhance reliability and functionality. The most significant fix addresses the model file path issue—models are now correctly saved to the models/ directory instead of the root directory. Additionally, the synthetic data generation now uses a minimum of 100 samples (previously 0) to prevent empty dataset errors that could cause training failures. The data directory creation logic has been streamlined for better efficiency, and informative print statements have been added to provide clear feedback on model performance metrics (Accuracy and F1 Score) and successful file saves. These changes ensure the GitHub Actions workflow runs smoothly and models are properly versioned and stored in the expected location.
